# AtHome_Projects
Individual Projects that I tried my hand at:

- _Graph Based Algorithms:_ understood and implemented various graph-based algorithms and data structures that are useful in finding the minimum distance between different combination of points

- *Topic Modelling using LDA and Gensim:* Tried to find relevant/trending topics from a large data set consisting of social media posts. This was done using basic NLP followed by semantic-based models such as LDR and Gensim

- *User Preference Prediction:* Looked at a data set that has user ratings for different items and created a recommendation engine that helps predict whether a user will like a particular item or not. 

- *XIRR Data Scraping and Automation:* Created an automated framework that scrapes and calculates financial metrics from various mutual funds on Money Control and provides weekly reports
