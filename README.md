Individual Projects that I tried my hand at:

- Graph Based Algorithms: understood and implemented various graph-based algorithms and data structures that are useful in finding the minimum distance between different combination of points

- Topic Modelling using LDA and Gensim: Tried to find relevant/trending topics from a large data set consisting of social media posts. This was done using basic NLP followed by semantic-based models such as LDR and Gensim
